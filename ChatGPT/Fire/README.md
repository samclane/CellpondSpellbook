Ignore previous prompts. Given a game where you can describe colored cells, and how they evolve in time states given by the surrounding cells' colors, give a rule for describing a fire effect. Rules are asynchronous and rules are randomly selected and applied in a random location.

Here is a rule that you can use to describe a fire effect in a game where cells are colored and evolve over time based on the colors of surrounding cells, and where rules are randomly selected and applied in a random location:

If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is not on fire (not red), it will become on fire (red) with a probability of 0.5.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is on fire (red), it will become an empty cell (white) with a probability of 0.5.
This rule describes a simple fire propagation effect, where fire can randomly spread to adjacent cells but eventually burns out and leaves an empty space. The use of probabilities allows for a certain amount of randomness and unpredictability in the evolution of the fire. Of course, you can adjust the rule to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you could increase or decrease the probability of fire spreading or burning out, or you could add additional colors to represent different stages of the fire's evolution. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Add more detail to the previous effect

Here is a more detailed variation on the fire propagation rule that takes into account the use of randomness and the asynchronous nature of the rules:

If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is not on fire (not red), it will become on fire (red) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is on fire (red), it will become an empty cell (white) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is not on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is not on fire (not red), it will become a partially burnt cell (orange) with a probability of 0.25 if at least one of its surrounding cells is on fire and no surrounding cells are not on fire.
This variation on the rule adds additional conditions and probabilities to create a more complex and realistic fire propagation effect. It also introduces a new color, orange, to represent partially burnt cells. This creates a more unpredictable and dynamic evolution of the fire, where fire can spread, burn out, or become partially burnt depending on the state of the surrounding cells. Of course, you can adjust the rule further to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you could change the probabilities of the different events, or you could add additional colors to represent different stages of the fire's evolution. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Add even more detail to the previous rule, please

Here is an even more detailed variation on the fire propagation rule that takes into account the use of randomness, the asynchronous nature of the rules, and the potential for different stages of the fire's evolution:

If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is not on fire (not red), it will become on fire (red) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is on fire and no surrounding cells are not on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is on fire (red), it will become an empty cell (white) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is not on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is not on fire (not red), it will become a partially burnt cell (orange) with a probability of 0.25 if at least one of its surrounding cells is on fire and no surrounding cells are not on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is partially burnt (orange), it will become on fire (red) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is on fire and no surrounding cells are not on fire.
If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is partially burnt (orange), it will become an empty cell (white) with a probability of 0.5



Sawyer McLane:
continue

Sure, here is the continuation of the previous rule:

If a cell is selected at random, and its current color is partially burnt (orange), it will become an empty cell (white) with a probability of 0.5 if at least one of its surrounding cells is not on fire.
This variation on the rule adds even more complexity and detail to the fire propagation effect. It introduces the concept of partially burnt cells, which can become on fire again if surrounded by on fire cells, or burn out if surrounded by empty cells. This creates a more realistic and dynamic evolution of the fire, where different stages of the fire's evolution can affect its spread and eventual burnout. Of course, you can adjust the rule further to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you could change the probabilities of the different events, or you could add additional colors to represent different stages of the fire's evolution. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
